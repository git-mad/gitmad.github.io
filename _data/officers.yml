  bio: Hey! I'm a second year CS Major and I am one of your Co-Presidents of GITMAD! I'm truly excited to be able to help improve this club! Last semester, I was the Events Coordinator and I was able to set up many Android-related Tech Talks with big companies such as Microsoft, State Farm, Capital One, UPS, and more! I have many plans for this club, including improving the curriculum by making it less complicating, as well as many more Tech talks throughout the year (so make sure to bring your resumes). Join us if you want to start learning Android!

  bio: Hello, I’m Fuad. I’m a CS and Chinese major. I founded and worked on my high school’s app team and work at Neopod currently. I’m most experienced in Java but have been trying to use Kotlin recently. I enjoy hackathons and have been trying to get into teaching.  My main interests are in how the user should be interacting with the app and project design/management. Please reach out if you have any questions or would like to talk!
