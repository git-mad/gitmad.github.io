  position: Vice President
  bio: Hey! I'm Clayton Lawrence and I'm currently a 5th year CS major. My fascination with Android is what got me into CS so I look forward to exploring and learning more about it with you all! During the summer following my Freshman year, I participated in Facebook University where I was an Android developer for 8 weeks and co-created a bucket-list app based on a user's Instagram data. This past summer I was an Android developer on Facebook Business Platform team where I worked on tools for business pages. As a sophomore, I joined GITMAD and helped create the social networking app, Bitter. Since then, I have served as president, given talks, and helped plan events. I can't wait to get into some cool Android concepts this year!!
