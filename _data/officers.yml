#   bio: Hello, I’m Fuad. I’m a CS and Chinese major. I founded and worked on my high school’s app team and work at Neopod currently. I’m most experienced in Java but have been trying to use Kotlin recently. I enjoy hackathons and have been trying to get into teaching.  My main interests are in how the user should be interacting with the app and project design/management.

#   position: Officer
#   bio: Hello, I am Akash, and I am a freshman at Georgia Institute of Technology. I have been coding since eighth grade, and it has always been my goal to impact those around me with technology and computer science. When I moved to the US initially in eighth grade from India, the relative "newness" of everything was astonishing and overwhelming, and something more stable and 
#        static like learning to code from home gave me a sense of purpose and a medium of connecting to other similar-minded individuals. And this is the energy that I have been leveraging ever since to build community-inspired software and products that helps and empowers people with computer science. I am excited to have been appointed as technical officer at GITMAD, and it 
#        is my absolute pleasure to have the opportunity to work with you and build some incredible apps!
